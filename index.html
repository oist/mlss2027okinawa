    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      MLSS 2027 Okinawa is the next edition of MLSS 2024 Okinawa. It is open to all applicants, and we aim to select 200 highly motivated participants. Our main target audience is master's and Ph.D. students with a strong technical background in machine learning related areas. A small number of industry practitioners, professors, researchers, and outstanding undergraduate students may also be considered depending on space and availability. Industry applicants may be able to attend through sponsorship from their company. All participants are expected to have experience programming in Python, a strong interest in machine learning, and a basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.

OIST is located in Onna Village, Okinawa, Japan, which is known as a beautiful resort area. The average temperature in Okinawa in March is around 16–21°C (61–70°F), and there are many beaches near OIST. One of the participants from MLSS 2024 made a YouTube video about the event (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvD8mQ8_UG4), so please take a look!
